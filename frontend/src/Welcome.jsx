        <p>
          SmartSpend is designed to help college students like you take better control over their spending habits.
          Without needing to share any sensitive information, you can set budgets for each card and track how much youâ€™ve spent.

        <h2>ðŸŽ“ Why I Built This</h2>
        <p>
          I know that many students depend on their parents financially, and often have to report how their money is being spent.
          This tool is a private and honest way to manage that. Whether itâ€™s textbooks, groceries, or travel, SmartSpend helps you stay on top of your finances and share your progress without stress.
